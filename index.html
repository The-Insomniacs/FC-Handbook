	Steven "Septimus Dracht" of The Insomniacs &#60;&#60;Sleep&#62;&#62;
	</h3>
	<br>

	<p>
	What does it means to be an officier in The Insomniacs?
	It means you're one of the family! This and everything it includes has been given to you.
	If you have questions about this role, feel free to ask Ash, Nando, Andy, or myself Steven (You should know our ingame names by now, but if you forgot, its Chain, Rem, Avery, and Septimus).
	Now onto the actual important stuff.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Responsibilities:
	</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>
		Be cool.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you fail #1, its fine, just fake it like me.
	</li>
	<li>	
		Dont be a dick (also falls under #1).
	</li>	
	<li>
		Recruitment. Now you dont need to go on huge invite spamming trips, but simply inviting people you meet to grow the Sleep family is expected.
	</li>
	<li>
		Be a Moderator in FC chat and Discord. This means using maturity and reason to determine when people are taking things too far, then send them a /tell to resolve the issue. (more on this under <a href="#probs">Dealing with Problem Members</a>)
	</li>
	<li>
		Remove members from the FC. This is usually done by Ash, or sometimes Andy and Steven. The removal of inactive members follows some general rules but has exceptions which is why so few people are expected to do this. If for some reason you must remove people, the general rule is that if someone is inactive for 90+ days, they will be removed iff they were not well known to the FC when active and/or their group of friends is no longer active. This is a delicate situaton as you might imagine the social circles of the FC are not well drawn out. The exception to this is when there is an (Unable to Retrieve), since these players have transfered or deleted their account you are free to kick them whenever you see one. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Upkeep of FC buffs is expected, there should always be at least a Heat 2 up, and a second buff which depends on the situation of the game, for example when people might be leveling crafters and gatherers we cycle between the respective buffs. When there is a gold saucer event we might have the mgp buff up. If in doubt, just as the fc what buff they want as the second one (also you get to be greedy sometimes with the second buff).
	</li>
	<li>
		The workshop is generally Andy's home, he does a lot of the stuff with the airships and stuff, Ash also has done a lot of work with them. As such if you are messing with that stuff, ask one of them first. The workshop can also be used to make tier 3 FC buffs, if you want to try and make them, contact one of the following, Ash, Septimus, or Andy.
	</li>
	<li>
		FC Events are expected to be ran by the officiers, these can be anything that a group of members might enjoy doing together and <b>does not</b> need to be FFXIV related, although many will be since we <i>are</i> an FC. Please try to run one of these as frequently as you can manage, since I do not see us going from a shortage of events to having too many without a lot of work. The goal is to have one or 2 every week. You may be greedy when thinking up these events, so if you need a few more tokens for a mount, you might make a EX farm event, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		As an officier you are expected to be a <i>bit</i> more mature than others, this does not mean you can't joke or can't tell someone to "fuck off", it just means we'd prefer it if you told them "stop" rather than "fuck off".
	</li>
	<li>
		Help other FC members by answering their questions and running things with them. This is obviously within reason and you do not need to drop what you are doing to help someone but if you are doing unimportant things or bored, then you are expected to help them.
	</li><li>
		Feed all the chcobos in the stable when you have a chance using feed in the FC chest. If there is not much in the chest either plant some in the garden or let Ash, Andy, or Steven know and they will do it. Try to use tier 3 shround soil, and pay attention to when maintenance starts as that can kill the crops.
	</li></ol>
	<h2>
	Rights:
	</h2>	
	<ol>
	<li>
		You can have your opinion heard in the Admin chat in our FC discord. This allows you to be part of the discussion when we make a decision regarding the FC. So please join the conversations had in there.
	</li><li>
		Control of the FC buffs within reason to benifit your personal play as outlined upder Responsibilities #7.
	</li><li>
		Protection from being kicked due to inactivity for as long as possible.
	</li><li>	
		Promotion of Recruits to Members and submitting anyone in the FC for a promotion in our Admin chat in discord. 
	</li><li>	
		Freedom to take breaks from the game for however long you might want/need.

	Dealing with Problem Members:
	</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<h3>
		In game:
		</h3>
			First of all, take a moment and reassess the situation to make sure that you do infact need to do something about what is going on.
			
			If you find that you do need to do something, first send them a /tell explaining why what they are doing is problematic while being pleasent since being nice to avoid an argument is important. After trying to get the other person to see what might be wrong with the way they are acting, you should ask them to please stop.
			
			If the problem continues, then you should attempt to send a few more /tells being more direct this time, at this point almost all conflicts will be at least temporarily solved. If this is not the case and another officier is online, contact them to get their help with the matter and send Ash, or Steven a message on discord if they are not online.
			
			At this point you must use your best judgement to determine if a kick from the FC is needed. I cannot cover all cases in this handbook, so here is where the trust we put in you when choosing you as a officier is needed. If problems continue with a Member and you have no other options, kick them.
			This is assuming it has continued in a single sitting, if this is a recurring problem, please let Ash, Andy, Nando or Steven kick them.
		</li><li>
		<h3>
		In Discord:
		</h3>
			Our discord server has some moderation tools which may be used in addition to applying the above advice when deeling with problems. Since you have these extra tools, it is expected that you will not kick members outside of <b>extreme</b> circumstances.
			<br>
			The extra tools you have are the following commands:
			<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>.mute [#] @annoying_user    Where [#] is an optional number in minutes for which the user will stay muted, without that number it will last 	till the user is unmuted.
					<br><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>
					eg. ".mute 60 @Mari" would mute the user Mari for an hour.
					</li></ul>
					
				</li><li> .unmute @no_longer_annoying_user     will umute a user who was muted. You can end a mute early by using this.
				<br><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>
					eg. ".unmute @Mari" would allow you to unmute Mari before the hour is up after you realize you made a mistake.
					</li></ul>
					
				</li><li> .prune [#]    This will remove the last [#] messages in a chat, the default is 100 if [#] is left out.
				<br><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>
					eg using ".prune" in the advice channel will remove the last 100 messages in there, and using ".prune 10" in general will remove the last 10 messages from there.
					</li></ul>
					</li></ul>
